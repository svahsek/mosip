== Overview

The Registration Client is a thick Java-based client where the
resident’s demographic and biometric details are captured along with the
supporting documents in online or offline mode. Data is captured in the
form of registration packets and is cryptographically secured to ensure
that there is no tampering. The captured information is packaged and
sent to the server for further processing.

MOSIP provides a reference implementation of a Java-based Registration
Client. The code, and build files for the Registration Client are
available in the
https://github.com/mosip/registration-client[Registration Client repo].

=== Multiple language support

* Registration Client is featured to allow an operator to choose the
operation language. The option to select their preferred language is
provided on the login screen.
* Data collection during registration client supports more than one
language at a time.
* Before starting any registration process, the operator can choose the
languages amongst the configured ones.

To know more about setting up the reference registration client, refer
to the
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-client/registration-client-installation-guide[Registration
Client Installation Guide].

Client User Guide].

=== Who operates the Registration Client?

The Registration Client can be operated by an operator who can be either
a *Supervisor* or an *Officer*. They can login to the client application
and perform various activities. The Supervisor and the Officer can
perform tasks like Onboarding, Synchronize Data, Upgrade software,
Export packets, Upload packets, View Re-registration packets, Correction
process, Exception authentication, etc. In addition to this, the
Supervisor has exclusive authority to Approve/reject registrations.

To know more about the onboarding process of an operator, refer to
link:../deploy/operator-onboarding.md[Operator onboarding].

The relationship of the Registration Client with other services is
explained here. _NOTE_: The numbers do not signify a sequence of
operations or control flow.

[arabic]
. Registration Client connects to the Upgrade Server to check on
upgrades and patch downloads.
. All the masterdata and configurations are downloaded from
SyncData-service.
. Registration Client always connects to external biometric devices
through SBI.
. Registration Client scans the document proofs from any document
scanner.
. Acknowledgment receipt print request is raised to any connected
printers.
. Packets ready to be uploaded meta-info are synced to the Sync Status
service. Also, the status of already uploaded packets is synced back to
the registration Client.
. All the synced packets are uploaded to the Packet Receiver service one
by one.

The image below shows the setup of the Registration Client Host machine.

[arabic]
. Registration Client comprises JavaFX UI, Registration-services
libraries, and any third-party biometric-SDK.
. SBI is allowed to run on loopback IP and should listen on any port
within the 4501-4600 range. More than one SBI can run on the host
machine. Registration Client scans the allowed port range to identify
the available SBI.
. Registration Client connects to the local Derby database. This is used
to store all the data synced.
. All the completed registration packets are stored under the
packetstore directory.
. `.mosipkeys` directory is used to store sensitive files. `db.conf`
under this directory stores encrypted DB passwords. This is created at
the start of the registration client for the first time.
. TPM - is the hardware security module used to get machine identifier,
secure DB password, and prove the client authenticity on auth requests
and packets created in the host machine.

=== Data protection

* The registration packets and synced data are stored in the client
machine.
* Most of the synced data are stored in the Derby DB. Derby DB is
encrypted with the bootpassword.
* Derby DB boot password is encrypted with the machine TPM key and
stored under `.mosipkeys/db.conf`.
* Synced UI-SPEC/script files are saved in plain text under the
registration client working directory. During sync, SPEC/script file
hash is stored in derby and then the files are saved in the current
working directory. Every time the file is accessed by the client
performs the hash check.
* Synced pre-registration packets are encrypted with a TPM key and
stored under the configured directory.
* The directory to store the registration packets and related
registration acknowledgments is configurable.
* The registration packet is a signed and encrypted ZIP.
* Registration acknowledgment is also signed and encrypted with a TPM
key.

=== Background Tasks

The Registration Client runs background tasks to keep data synchronized
with the Registration Processor. It continuously updates the server with
newly created packets and syncs additional metadata to improve packet
recovery in case of a client failure.

Another background task handles packet uploads. If supervisor approval
is required (`'y'`), approved packets are uploaded in batches. If
approval is not required (`'n'`), packets are uploaded during the next
scheduled job. With this feature, the registration client has fully
capable auto upload.

You can configure these settings in the
link:../deploy/registration-client-configuration.md#scheduled-jobs[Scheduled
Jobs] and
link:../deploy/registration-client-configuration.md#batch-size[Batch
Configuration] sections.

=== Configurations

Registration Client can be customized as per a country’s requirements.
For details related to Registration Client configurations, refer to
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-client/registration-client-configuration[Registration
Client configuration].

=== UI Specifications for Registration Tasks

* The blueprint of registration forms to be displayed in the
registration client is created as json called UI-SPEC.
* Every process ( NEW / LOST / UPDATE UIN / CORRECTION ) has its own
UI-SPEC json.
* Kernel-masterdata-service exposes APIs to create and publish UI-SPEC.
* Published UI-SPEC json are versioned.
* Only published UI-SPEC is synced into registration-client.
* UI-SPEC json files are tamper proof, the client checks the stored file
hash every time it tries to load the registration UI.
* UI-SPEC json will fail to load if tampered.

Default UI Specifications loaded with Sandbox installation is available
https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/blob/1.2.0-rc2/deployment/v3/mosip/kernel/masterdata/xlsx/ui_spec.xlsx[here]
