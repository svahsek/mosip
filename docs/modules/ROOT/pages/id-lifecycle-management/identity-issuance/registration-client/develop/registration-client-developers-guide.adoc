== Developers Guide

=== Overview

https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-client[Registration
Client] is a thick Java-based client where the resident’s demographic
and biometric details are captured along with the supporting documents
in online or offline mode.

The documentation here will guide you through the prerequisites required
for the developer’ setup.

=== Software setup

Below are a list of tools required in Registration Client:

[arabic]
. JDK 11
. Any IDE (like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
. Apache Maven (zip folder)
. Git

Follow the steps below to set up Registration Client on your local
system:

=== Code setup

For the code setup, clone the
https://github.com/mosip/registration-client[Registration Client]
repository and follow the guidelines mentioned in the
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/community/code-contributions[Code
Contributions].

==== Importing and building of a project

[arabic]
. Open the project folder where `pom.xml` is present.
. Open command prompt from the same folder.
. Run the command `mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip=true -DskipTests=true`
to build the project and wait for the build to complete successfully.
. After building of a project, open Eclipse and select
`Import Projects → Maven → Existing Maven Projects → Next → Browse to project directory → Finish`.
. After successful importing of project, update the project by
right-click on `Project → Maven → Update Project`.

=== Environment setup

{empty}1. For the environment setup, you need an external dependency
that is available
https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;gav~~mock-sdk~1.2.0-SNAPSHOT~~[here]
with different versions. (E.g.: You can download `mock-sdk.jar` and add
to registration-services project
`Libraries → Classpath → Add External JARs → Select Downloaded JAR → Add → Apply and Close`).

{empty}2. Registration Client UI is developed using JavaFX and the UI
pages are fxml files which can be opened using a tool called
`Scene Builder`. The JavaFX integration with the Eclipse IDE is provided
with the e(fx)clipse tool. Go to
`Help → Install New Software → Work with → Add`. Give Name and Location
as mentioned in below image.

Once the software is installed, you will be prompted to restart your
IDE.

{empty}3. Download `openjfx-11.0.2++_++windows-x64++_++bin-sdk.zip` from
https://github.com/mosip/documentation/tree/1.2.0/docs/_files/registration-client-config-files[here],
unzip and place it in your local file system. This folder contains list
of javafx related jars that are necessary for running Registration
Client UI.

{empty}4. We can change the application environment in the file
`registration-services++\++src++\++main++\++resources++\++props++\++mosip-application.properties`
by modifying the property `mosip.hostname`

Below are the configurations to be done in Eclipse:

{empty}1. Open Eclipse and run the project for one time as
`Java application`, so that it creates a Java application which you can
see in debug configurations.

{empty}2. Open the arguments and pass this
`--module-path C:++\++Users++\<++USER++_++NAME++>\++Downloads++\++openjfx-11.0.2++_++windows-x64++_++bin-sdk++\++javafx-sdk-11.0.2++\++lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.base,javafx.web,javafx.swing,javafx.graphics --add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.application=ALL-UNNAMED`
in VM arguments.

{empty}3. Click Apply and then debug it (starts running). You can see a
popup which shows informative messages of what is happening in
background while Registration Client UI is loading and the application
will be launched.

=== Running the Registration Client Downloader Docker image

* Dockerfile is available under
https://github.com/mosip/registration-client/blob/release-1.2.0.1/registration/Dockerfile[registration-client
repository].
* The concept here is to run nginx in the docker container from which
registration-client.zip is hosted and also registration-client on the
field will connect to this nginx to check for new updates or changes.

_Note:_ We refer this nginx server as registration-client download and
upgrade server.

While running the registration-client docker container we need to pass
below environment variables:

*Required*

`client++_++version++_++env` : pom version of the registration client
build

`client++_++upgrade++_++server++_++env` : public URL of this nginx
server

`reg++_++client++_++sdk++_++url++_++env` : URL to download sdk zip. Make
sure to have SDK jar and its dependent jars in the zip.

artifactory++_++url++_++env : artifactory URL to download below
mentioned runtime dependencies

“$++{++artifactory++_++url}/artifactory/libs-release-local/icu4j/icu4j.jar”

“$++{++artifactory++_++url}/artifactory/libs-release-local/icu4j/kernel-transliteration-icu4j.jar”

“$++{++artifactory++_++url}/artifactory/libs-release-local/clamav/clamav.jar”

“$++{++artifactory++_++url}/artifactory/libs-release-local/clamav/kernel-virusscanner-clamav.jar”

`keystore++_++secret++_++env` : password of the keystore.p12 file

`host++_++name++_++env` : syncdata-service public domain name

`signer++_++timestamp++_++url++_++env` : URL of timestamp server to
timestamp registration-client jar files.

*Need to mount a volume to “/home/mosip/build++_++files” with below
files*

* logback.xml
* Client.crt : Signer certificate to be added in the registration-client
build for jar sign verification.
* keystore.p12 : Store private key used to sign the registation-client
and registration-services jar files with “CodeSigning” alias.
* maven.metadata.xml : Holds the current version of registration-client
hosted in the upgrade server.

*Optional*

`reg++_++client++_++custom++_++impls++_++url++_++env` : URL to download
scanner custom implementation jars(runtime dependency).

Finally, you can download the registration client zip from below URL.
++{++registratiionclient download server domain
name/ip}/registration-client/++{++client++_++version}/reg-client.zip}

*References*

Run
(https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/blob/develop/deployment/v3/mosip/regclient/create-signing-certs.sh)
to generate `Client.crt` and `keystore.p12`.

To get the content of `maven-metadata.xml` and `logback.xml` check
