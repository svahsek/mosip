Upon successful verification of the credentials, the packet will be
uploaded to the server and the operator will be redirected to the
`Acknowledgment` screen. This screen includes the following information:

* Application ID
* Timestamp of Registration
* Demographic data captured
* Documents uploaded
* Biometric data captured
* Print option

Acknowledgement page

*Pending Approval:*

Upon successful verification of the credentials, the acknowledgment will
be displayed, and the Application will be moved to the “Pending
Approval” section. This feature will only be available for the User who
has a Supervisor’s role assigned to him.

Once the packet is created by the Operator, as an additional check, the
Supervisor will have to go through each application to make sure the
details filled are coherent.

*Step 1:* The user goes to the “Pending Approval” section from the
Operational Tasks section. The user will be taken to the page where they
can see the list of all the Applications created by the Operator. All of
these Applications will be “Pending”.

Supervisor’s approval

*Step 2:* The Supervisor then clicks on the Application ID one by one.
At this stage, the Supervisor can either Approve the Application or he
can Reject it. If the Supervisor decides to reject it, they also will
have to mandatorily mention the reason for rejection.

*Step 3:* Once the Application has been Approved or Rejected, the
Supervisor will have to authenticate himself by clicking on the “Submit”
button and thereby entering their Username and Password. The User can
also bulk submit the Applications. The only pre-requisite is that the
packet has to be in Approved or Rejected status (pending Applications
cannot be submitted for uploading). Once they have successfully
authenticated, the Application will be removed from the “Pending
Approval” section and will be moved to the “Manage Application” Section.

Pending approval

*Step 4:* Once the Application is either Approved or Rejected by the
Supervisor and is submitted, those packets can be uploaded to the server
from the “Manage Application” section or can be exported to their local
device storage.

*Manual Application upload/export*

Once the Application is either Approved or Rejected by the Supervisor,
those packets can be uploaded to the server from the “Manage
Application” section.

Manage application

*Step 1:* The user selects the packets they want to upload (bulk upload
can also be done). Once selected, the user clicks on the “Upload”
button, after which the packet syncs and gets uploaded if there is
internet connectivity.

In case of a lack of internet connectivity, the User can also export the
packet to their local device storage. They can also bulk export the
packets by choosing the Applications and clicking on the Export button.

On choosing to upload, the packet is uploaded to the
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-processor[Registration
Processor]. Once the packet has been successfully processed, a unique
identification number (UIN) is generated.

[arabic]
. *Print*- The operator can click on this option to obtain a physical
copy of the acknowledgment.
. *New Registration*- The operator can initiate another registration by
clicking on this option.

In summary, the user (Operator/ Supervisor) can follow the
aforementioned steps to register an individual by capturing demographic
data, documents, and biometric data to generate their UIN.

*Operator Onboarding*: To begin the Onboarding process, the Operator is
required to follow the steps outlined below. The operator, to log in to
the Android Registration Client, will have to onboard himself. This
functionality will be available on first-time online login only.

[loweralpha]
. On logging in for the first time, the Operator will be taken to the
screen where they will have the following two options:

[arabic]
. *Get onboard:* This flow is present for the system to verify the
Operator’s biometrics with their registered biometrics. This is to
enable local deduplication. To get onboarded the operator must not be
assigned "`default`" role.
. *Skip to home:* This flow is to dodge “Operator’s Onboarding”. If the
user selects this, they will be taken to the “Homepage” after which the
user can get started with Resident registration. One of the
prerequisites of this flow is to have the “Default” role mapped to the
center.
