==== Set up Mock MDS for Biometric Scan

The Mock MDS tool can be utilized to simulate the functionalities of
biometric devices. The Mock MDS application is compliant with CTK
standards and can serve as a substitute for Android SBI modules during
testing and validation.

[arabic]
. Install the Mock MDS application.
. Access the *Settings* menu.
. Under Device Configuration, choose *Registration* from the dropdown
menu.
. In P12 Configuration:
* Enter the necessary credentials for the Device Key and upload the
Device P12 file.
* Enter the required credentials for the FTM Key and upload the FTM P12
file.
