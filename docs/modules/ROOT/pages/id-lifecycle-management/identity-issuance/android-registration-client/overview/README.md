# Overview

## Overview

The Android Registration Client is a tablet application that serves as a portable version of the existing desktop [Registration Client](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-client). It has been developed to support accessibility on all Android devices. The creation of the Android Registration Client was driven by the need to meet the mobility requirements of countries adopting MOSIP.

The primary objective of the tablet version is to facilitate the registration process for residents, especially those who are unable to physically visit registration centers. It also serves remote locations where setting up registration centers is not feasible. To address this challenge, the Android Registration Client was created, enabling operators and supervisors to easily reach remote areas and maximize resident registrations across the country.
