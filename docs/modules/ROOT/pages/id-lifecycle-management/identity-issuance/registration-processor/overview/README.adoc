== Overview

=== Introduction

Registration Processor (Regproc) is a backend processing engine to
enable ID Lifecycle management. The diagram below shows the Registration
Processor along with the other modules that contribute to issuing a
Unique Identification Number(UIN) for an individual. Internally, Regproc
follows the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture[SEDA]
architecture where data flows via multiple stages till the UIN is
issued.

The relationship of Regproc with other services is explained here.
_NOTE: The numbers do not signify a sequence of operations or control
flow_

[arabic]
. Registration packets are uploaded by the
link:../../registration-client/[Registration Client] to the
https://github.com/mosip/registration/tree/release-1.2.0/registration-processor/init/registration-processor-packet-receiver-stage[Packet
Receiver].
. After packet validation is done Regproc notifies the pre-registration
application using the datasync service.
. The quality of biometrics is checked using an external biometric SDK.
This is done in Regproc’s
https://github.com/mosip/registration/blob/release-1.2.0/registration-processor/pre-processor/registration-processor-quality-classifier-stage/README.md[Quality
Classifier stage].
. Regproc shares biometric data with
link:../../../supporting-components/biometrics/abis.md[ABIS], Manual
adjudication System, and Verification System. The policy for sharing
this data is fetched from
link:../../../support-systems/partner-management-services/[PMS].
. The above data is shared by providing a URL that partners use to fetch
data. This URL is obtained from the
link:../../../supporting-components/datashare.md[Datashare] service.
. Regproc’s
https://github.com/mosip/registration/tree/release-1.2.0/registration-processor/core-processor/registration-processor-abis-middleware-stage[ABIS
Middleware stage] communicates with
link:../../../supporting-components/biometrics/abis.md[ABIS] via
https://activemq.apache.org/[Activemq]. The ABIS performs deduplication
and sends back the result to the Queue.
. Regproc stores and updates applicant demographic and biometric
information in the https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/id-repository[ID
Repository]. Also, activate or deactivate the applicant’s UIN.
. Regproc calls IDA Internal Authentication Service to authenticate
Applicant(for update flow), introducer, operator, and supervisor(when
bio auth mode is used to create packet).
. After the UIN is processed the
https://github.com/mosip/registration/tree/release-1.2.0/registration-processor/post-processor/registration-processor-printing-stage[Printing
Stage] calls
https://github.com/mosip/id-repository/tree/release-1.2.0/id-repository/credential-service[Credential
Service] to create credentials for print. This credential will be pushed
to websub and the Printing systems will consume the same.
. The
https://github.com/mosip/registration/tree/release-1.2.0/registration-processor/registration-processor-notification-service[Notification
Service] is used to send email/sms notifications to the applicant after
the request processing is completed on the server.
. Regproc connects to the external "`Manual Adjudication System`" via a
queue. Regproc sends applicant information required for adjudication in
the queue and the external adjudication system consumes it. The data is
shared from mosip to an external adjudication system based on policy.
. Regproc calls https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/keymanager[Key
Manager] for decrypting packets and encrypting information.
. Regproc uses
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/deployment/masterdata-guide[Masterdata
Service] to validate the center, machine, user, etc.
. Regproc connects to Virus Scanner for scanning packets in the
https://github.com/mosip/registration/tree/release-1.2.0/registration-processor/init/registration-processor-packet-receiver-stage[Packet
Receiver Stage] and
https://github.com/mosip/registration/tree/release-1.2.0/registration-processor/pre-processor/registration-processor-packet-uploader-stage[Packet
Uploader Stage]
. Each Stage in regproc calls
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/packet-manager[Packet Manager] to
read information from the packet.

=== Stages and services

The Registration Processor contains several
https://github.com/mosip/registration/tree/release-1.2.0#registration-stages-and-pipeline[stages
and services].

The registration packet flows through the various stages depending on
the type of flow. See
https://github.com/mosip/registration/blob/release-1.2.0/docs/flows.md[Registration
Flows and Stage Sequence].

*Note*: The Print Stage has been renamed as the Credential Requestor
Stage. For further information, please click
