# End User Guide

### Overview

This guide helps in understanding the pre-registration sample UI implementation. The pre-registration portal can be used in **self-service** as well as in **assisted** mode.

#### **Self-service mode**

In this mode, residents can pre-register themselves by accessing the pre-registration portal. They can login with their email address or phone number and fill up the demographic form, upload relevant documents to book an appointment for themselves and their family/friends. Finally, they would receive an acknowledgment along with a pre-registration ID that can be used at the registration center.

#### **Assisted mode**

When used in an assisted mode, the operator could be handling the portal helping other residents fill up the details, and creating an application on their behalf. The languages that the operator and the resident understand, may or may not be the same. If we consider a country with linguistic diversity, the possibilities increase. In such cases, the operator might log in with a language that they are familiar with, and also select a language (data capture language) familiar to the resident for filling up the demographic form and other details.

## Pre-registration process

The key steps in this process are:

* Login/create a user account
* Create an application
* Book an appointment
* Receive appointment acknowledgement

To create an application, the resident/operator can follow the steps below:

### Login/create a user account

![Pre-registration login page](../../../../.gitbook/assets/pre-reg-login.png)

1. Open the browser and visit the pre-registration portal.
2. Select the **language** of your preference from the dropdown.
3. Enter your valid email address or phone number in the text box.
4. Select the Captcha field.
5. Click **Send OTP** to receive a One Time Password (OTP) on your provided email address or mobile number.
6. Enter the OTP and click **Verify**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you have not received the One-Time Password (OTP), please click on **Send** to request another OTP. Enter the newly received OTP to proceed. Once your OTP has been successfully verified, you will be able to create, view, or update your pre-registration application.
{% endhint %}

### Create an application

#### Step 1: Select the language for providing data

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/pre-reg-language-selection.png)

1. Once the OTP is verified, you will see a pop-up for selecting the languages for data entry.
2. Select the languages and click **Submit**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

* This choice will be available only if the ID issuer has configured the usage of optional languages.
* Countries will have multiple languages some of which will be _mandatory_ while others could be _optional(regional languages)_. MOSIP provides a configuration using which a country can mandate the capture of demographic data in the required number of languages (a combination of mandatory and optional).
{% endhint %}

#### Step 2: Provide consent

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/pre-reg-consent.png)

1. On the Demographic details page, read the **Terms and Conditions** and select the check box to agree. This agreement is to provide consent for the storage and processing of your personal information.

![Dashboard](../../../../.gitbook/assets/pre-reg-application-status.jpg)

Once the application is created, there could be multiple statuses depending on the data filled by the user/resident or the actions performed by them. The user can view all the pre-registration applications created by them in the Dashboard. The different statuses with a brief explanation are mentioned below:
