### Overview

Resident services are self-service tools utilized by residents through an online portal. The [Resident Portal](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/resident-services/resident-portal-user-guide) is a web-based user interface application that offers services related to the residents' Unique Identification Number (UIN). Through this portal, residents can perform various operations related to their UIN or VID and can also raise any concerns they may have.

### Design Principles

The design of the Resident portal embodies the following principles:

* **One-stop solution**: The Resident portal is designed to have components that aim to solve all the queries, issues, or discrepancies of the residents and act as a one-stop solution for all the requirements.
* **Self-Sovereign**: Once the ID is issued by an authority, the user/resident/citizen chooses to control and manage their data in their choice of devices.
* **Inclusive**: The Resident portal aims to be available in all browsers while also catering to the needs of visually impaired, dyslexic, and color-blind folks.
* **Presence assurance**: This web-based UI application would put in all its efforts to ensure easy access to all the residents with high availability.
* **Works Remote**: The Resident portal should be able to share credentials when data needs to be shared remotely without physical presence.
* **Trusted**: The identity verification process on the device should be trusted so that it can be used in service delivery without any concerns.
* **Grievance redressal**: The Resident portal ensures that in case of any concerns or grievances, the issue is raised and resolved through the portal itself.
