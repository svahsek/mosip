# Module Configurations

## Overview

Properties that are shared across all modules are written in the file [`application-default.properties`](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-config/blob/release-1.2.0/application-default.properties).

Module-specific properties are written in respective `*.properties` files in [mosip-config](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-config/blob/release-1.2.0)

## Config server

Config server is a [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/multi/multi__spring_cloud_config_server.html) that serves the above properties to modules during run-time. The property files are downloaded when an application starts. The config server is installed as part of [sandbox installation](../../broken-reference/).

Some of the important properties that must be reviewed and modified for a specific deployment are listed below.
