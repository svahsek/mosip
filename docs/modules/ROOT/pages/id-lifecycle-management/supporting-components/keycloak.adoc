== Keycloak

=== Overview

Keycloak serves as the administrative access control module in MOSIP,
managing authentication and authorization across its microservices.
Since MOSIP is built on a microservice architecture, it heavily relies
on OAuth 2.0 tokens for access control. These tokens contain embedded
role definitions that determine who can access specific microservice
APIs ensuring secure and granular access control.

==== Keycloak’s Role in MOSIP

* *Microservice Security* – Each MOSIP microservice validates incoming
API requests using OAuth 2.0 tokens issued by Keycloak. If the token
lacks the necessary role, access is denied. This mechanism applies
universally, even between internal MOSIP modules, ensuring a zero-trust
architecture.
* *Data Access Control* – Most sensitive data in MOSIP is encrypted in
the database, making APIs the only entry point for accessing
information. Keycloak enforces strict authentication and authorization
policies, preventing internal attacks and API misuse.
* *Administrative Oversight* – Administrators can monitor and control
access permissions centrally via Keycloak, providing visibility into who
can access what within the system.
* *User Repository Management* – Keycloak also functions as the internal
identity store for critical MOSIP roles, including:
** *Operators* – Handle citizen registration and data collection.
** *Supervisors* – Oversee registration processes and ensure compliance.
** *Adjudicators* – Review and resolve identity conflicts or duplicate
registrations.

By enforcing strict access controls and acting as both an identity
provider and an authorization enforcer Keycloak helps MOSIP maintain
high security, scalability, and compliance while protecting against
unauthorized access.
