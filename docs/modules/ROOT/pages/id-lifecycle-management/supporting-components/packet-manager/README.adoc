Store].
. Performs in-memory encryption and decryption of packets.
. Performs security checks, checksum, file validations, ID object
validations, etc. on the registration packet.
. Provides packet information to other services via APIs. In case of
multiple packets associated with an ID, pulls information from packets
based on configured priority. (See
https://github.com/mosip/mosip-config/blob/develop3-v3/application-default.properties[`packetmanager.default.priority`]).

Packet Manager runs as a service and is also available as a library.
