{% hint style="info" %}
Capture Time across modalities should be less than 4 Seconds (time taken for providing a final capture response to the calling application, when the biometrics are well placed on the sensors)
{% endhint %}

We recommend that countries look at ergonomics, accessibility, ease of usage, and common availability of devices while choosing devices for use in registration and authentication scenarios.

## XML Container

The biometric data is wrapped in [CBEFF XML](broken-reference).
