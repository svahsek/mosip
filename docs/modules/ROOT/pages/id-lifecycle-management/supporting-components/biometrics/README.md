# Biometrics

## Overview

MOSIP platform integrates with the following biometric key components:

1. [Biometric devices](biometric-devices.md) - Captures biometric data (fingerprint, iris, and face) for registration and authentication.
2. [ABIS](abis.md) - Facilitates biometric de-duplication and identification to ensure uniqueness and prevent identity fraud.
3. [Biometric SDK](biometric-sdk.md) - Provides integration tools for biometric data capture, processing, and quality checks.

All biometric components must comply with MOSIP's standard interfaces. Compatibility can be verified using the provided test kits.

Vendors supplying biometric systems are recognized as MOSIP [Partners](../../support-systems/partner-management-services/partners.md).

## Modalities

MOSIP supports the following biometric modalities:

1. [Fingerprint](biometric-specification.md#fingerprint) - Defines fingerprint capture and authentication device specifications per ISO 19794-4:2011, covering resolution, image quality, compression, and operational standards.
2. [Iris](biometric-specification.md#iris) - Outlines iris capture and authentication device specifications per ISO 19794-6:2011, detailing resolution, image quality, compression, and operational standards.
3. [Face](biometric-specification.md#face-capture) - Defines face capture and authentication device specifications per ISO 19794-5:2011, covering camera quality, image standards, compression, and operational requirements.
