== Biometric Devices

=== Overview

Biometric devices capture individualsâ€™ biometric data (fingerprint, iris
scan, photo) and send it to a registration client or authentication
client (app). The functional architecture of the various entities
involved is shown below.

=== Compliance test kit

Compliance of a device may be tested using an
https://docs.mosip.io/compliance-tool-kit[Compliance Tool Kit (CTK)].

=== Devices calculator

The following calculator may be used to estimate the number of devices
required for a rollout.
