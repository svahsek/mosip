== Biometric Specification

=== Introduction

Biometric images for various modalities are captured, represented, and
exchanged according to the specifications outlined below.

=== Change History

The below table outlines the updates and modifications made to the
biometric specifications over time.

We recommend that countries look at ergonomics, accessibility, ease of
usage, and common availability of devices while choosing devices for use
in registration and authentication scenarios.

=== XML Container

The biometric data is wrapped in link:broken-reference[CBEFF XML].
