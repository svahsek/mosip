== Partners

=== Overview

The MOSIP platform requires integration with several other systems.
Typically, a System Integrator (SI) would assemble all the pieces to
build a complete national ID solution. All entities that participate in
providing the external components are called MOSIP Partners.

The below diagram illustrates the *MOSIP Ecosystem*, highlighting how
the MOSIP platform integrates with various components to provide a
complete ID solution.

authentication like banks, telecom, Govt. institutes etc.
|`Auth++_++Partner`

|Online Verification Partner |Authorised and entrusted partners who host
link:../../identity-verification/id-authentication.md[IDA] module to
provide authentication service to various partners. Even MOSIPs IDA
module an is an Online Verification Partner.

|Credential Partner |Provider of credentials like printed ID card, QR
code etc. to residents |`Credential++_++Partner`

|Device Provider |Provider of biometric devices that connect to
registration client and authentication apps |`Device++_++Provider`

|FTM Provider |Providers of

compatible link:../../supporting-components/biometrics/ftm.md[FTM]
integrated in biometric devices |`FTM++_++Provider`

|`ABIS++_++Partner`

|MISP Partner |MOSIP Infra Service Provider (MISP) provide network
infrastructure/channel/pipe to various Authentication Partners to
connect to the MOSIP system. Example, broadband service providers.

=== Partner Policies

The MOSIP Partner Policy establishes a structured framework for
collaboration between MOSIP adopters and their partners and defines the
rules for data access and sharing. 

It specifies which partners can access what information and the
procedures for requesting it, for instance, a registered print provider
automatically receives data via WebSub if designated under the print
policy whereas an authentication partner must actively call the
authentication system to retrieve data based on policy guidelines. If
eKYC is permitted, the partner may receive additional personally
identifiable information (PII). 

The policy ensures granular control over shared attributes allowing
different partners to receive varying levels of information; one may
access only a name while another may obtain both a name and a
photograph. This structured approach enhances security, compliance, and
flexibility.

=== Partner onboarding

Onboarding of a partner refers to registering a partner in a particular
deployment of MOSIP. Partners need to be onboarded to establish trust.
The onboarding process consists of loading partner details in the
database, exchanging certificates, etc, detailed in the later sections.
Such onboarding is required to be done on any fresh MOSIP installation.
For instance, if you install a sandbox, you would need to follow the
onboarding process for each partner.

The sections below describe the onboarding process for each type of
partner.

==== MISP

[arabic]
. MISP should have a trusted X.509 certificate with a chain of CA
certificates.
. MISP self-registers on the PMS portal providing partner ID, name,
organization name (same as in certificate), partner type
(`MISP++_++type`) (_This functionality will be available on the portal
in the 1.2.x version of MOSIP_)
. MISP uploads all certificates.
. MOSIP Admin generates the MISP license key and provides it to MISP.

==== Authentication Partner (AP)

[arabic]
. Policy for the AP must be pre-defined (see
link:partners.md#partner-policies[Partner policies]).
. AP should have a trusted X.509 certificate with a chain of CA
certificates.
. AP registers with MISP and obtains the MISP license key (this setup is
outside of the MOSIP system).
. The MISP used by AP should have been already onboarded onto MOSIP.
. AP self-registers on the PMS portal providing partner ID, name,
organization name (same as in certificate), partner type
(`Auth++_++Partner`) etc.
. AP uploaded all certificates.
. AP selects the policy group and policy. This request is sent to the
MOSIP Admin for approval.
. On approval, AP generates an API key that can be used along with the
MISP license key to interact with the IDA system.

==== Device Provider (DP)

[arabic]
. DP should have a trusted X.509 certificate with a chain of CA
certificates.
. DP self-registers on the PMS portal providing partner ID, name,
organization name (same as in certificate), partner type
(`Device++_++Provider`) etc.
. DP uploads all certificates.
. Any approval from MOSIP? (TODO)

==== FTM Provider (FTMP)

[arabic]
. FTMP should have a trusted X.509 certificate with a chain of CA
certificates.
. FTMP self-registers on the PMS portal providing partner ID, name,
organization name (same as in certificate), partner type
(`FTM++_++Provider`) etc.
. FTMP uploads all certificates.
. TODO

==== Credential Partner (CP)

[arabic]
. Datashare policy must be pre-defined (see
link:partners.md#partner-policies[Partner policies]).
. CP should have a trusted X.509 certificate with a chain of CA
certificates.
. CP self-registers on the PMS portal providing partner ID, name,
organization name (same as in certificate), partner type
(`Credential++_++Partner`) etc.
. CP uploads all certificates.
. CP selects the policy group and policy.
. CP maps policy to one of the supported
https://github.com/mosip/id-repository/tree/release-1.2.0/id-repository/credential-service[credential
types].
. CP adds biometric extractors for the policy.

==== Online Verification Partner (OVP)

[arabic]
. Datashare policy must be pre-defined (see
link:partners.md#partner-policies[Partner policies]).
. OVP should have a trusted X.509 certificate with a chain of CA
certificates.
. OVP self-registers on the PMS portal providing partner ID, name,
organization name (same as in certificate), partner type
(`Credential++_++Partner`) etc. _(Using APIs, as OVP support on PMS
Portal is available in the later version of MOSIP.)_
. OVP uploads all certificates.
. OVP selects the policy group and policy.
. OVP maps policy to `auth`
https://github.com/mosip/id-repository/tree/release-1.2.0/id-repository/credential-service[credential
type].
. OVP adds biometric extractors for the policy.

=== MOSIP Partner Program

The MOSIP Partner Programme (MPP) was initiated to help stakeholders
connect with MOSIP, and become part of an ecosystem invested in building
foundational digital ID systems that are trustworthy, secure, efficient,
and interoperable while being customized to specific needs.
