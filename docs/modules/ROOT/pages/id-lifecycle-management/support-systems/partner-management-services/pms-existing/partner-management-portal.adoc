=== Policies

To create policies, policy groups should be defined. Policy groups can
be considered as the regulatory bodies in a country, examples could be
Telecom, Insurance, Banking, etc.

==== Creation of Policy group

* Login as `Partner Admin` into the PMS portal.
* After successful login, on the left navigation pane, click on *Policy
-++>++ Policy Group*.
* The existing policy groups are listed on the screen and the new ones
can be created.

To search or filter any data pertaining to policy groups, use the filter
menu.

You can also change the status of policy group(Deactivate/Re-activate)
or edit it using the Action menu as shown below.

On successful creation of Policy groups, polices can be created under
that group. MOSIP supports two types of policies, i.e., *Auth* policy
and *Datashare* policy.

=== Auth Policy

By default, on clicking Auth policy, the screen displays the list of
existing auth link:../partners.md#partner-policies[policies].

Policy menu options.

=== Partner

==== Self Registration

Partners in MOSIP are created in a self-service mode. The partner visits
the MOSIP partner management portal and requests for collaborating with
MOSIP by providing basic details such as organization name and email-id,
purpose of registration (how they want to collaborate with MOSIP - as a
device provider, authentication partner, print partner, etc), basic
credentials and performing an OTP based verification. Once these details
are filled by the partner and a request is sent to MOSIP, the
`Partner Admin` verifies the details of the partners and allows the
partner to integrate with MOSIP.
