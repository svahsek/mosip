== Partner Management Services Developers Guide

=== Overview

https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/partner-management-services[Partner
Management Services] are the self-services which are used by the
partners themselves via a portal. Partner Management Portal is a web
based UI application that provides services to various types of
partners.

Partner Management module has two services:

* Policy Management service
* Partner Management service

The documentation here will guide you through the prerequisites required
for the developer’s setup.

=== Software setup

Below are a list of tools required in Partner Management Services setup:

[arabic]
. JDK 11
. Any IDE (like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
. Apache Maven (zip folder)
. pgAdmin
. Postman
. Git
. Notepad{plus}{plus} (optional)
. lombok.jar (file)
. settings.xml (document)

Follow the steps below to set up Partner Management Services on your
local system:

* Download `lombok.jar` and `settings.xml` from
https://github.com/mosip/documentation/tree/1.2.0/docs/_files/partner-management-services-config-files[here].
* Unzip Apache Maven and move the unzipped folder in
`C:++\++Program Files` and `settings.xml` to `conf` folder
`C:++\++Program Files++\++apache-maven-3.8.4++\++conf`.
* Install Eclipse, open the `lombok.jar` file and wait for some time
until it completes the scan for Eclipse IDE and then click
`Install/Update`.

* Check the Eclipse installation folder
`C:++\++Users++\++userName++\++eclipse++\++jee-2021-12++\++eclipse` to
see if the `lombok.jar` is added. By doing this, you don’t have to add
the dependency of `lombok` in your `pom.xml` file separately as it is
auto-configured by Eclipse.
* Configure the JDK (Standard VM) with your Eclipse by traversing
through `Preferences → Java → Installed JREs`.

=== Code setup

For the code setup, clone the repository and follow the guidelines
mentioned in the
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/community/code-contributions[Code
Contributions].

==== Importing and building of a project

[arabic]
. Open the project folder where `pom.xml` is present.
. Open command prompt from the same folder.
. Run the command `mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip=true -DskipTests=true`
to build the project and wait for the build to complete successfully.
. After building of a project, open Eclipse and select
`Import Projects → Maven → Existing Maven Projects → Next → Browse to project directory → Finish`.
. After successful importing of project, update the project by
right-click on `Project → Maven → Update Project`.

=== Environment setup

* For the environment setup, you need an external JAR that is available
https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;gav~~kernel-auth-adapter~1.2.0-SNAPSHOT~~[here]
with different versions. (E.g.: You can download
`kernel-auth-adapter.jar` and add to project
`Libraries → Classpath → Add External JARs → Select Downloaded JAR → Add → Apply and Close`).

image:../../../../.gitbook/assets/add-external-library.png[../../../../.gitbook/assets/add-external-library]

* Clone https://github.com/mosip/mosip-config[mosip-config repository].
* Create an empty folder inside the `mosip-config` with `sandbox-local`
name and then copy and paste all config files inside `sandbox-local`
folder except `.gitignore, README and LICENSE`.
* As Partner Management Services is using two properties files,
`partner-management-default` and `application-default`, you will have to
configure them according to your environment. The same files are
available
https://github.com/mosip/documentation/tree/1.2.0/docs/_files/partner-management-services-config-files[here]
for reference.
* To run the server, two files are required-
https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;gav~~kernel-config-server~1.2.0-SNAPSHOT~~[kernel-config-server.jar]
and
https://github.com/NagarjunaKuchi/documentation/blob/1.2.0/docs/_files/partner-management-services-config-files/config-server-start.bat[config-server-start.bat].
* Put both the files in the same folder and change the location
attribute to `sandbox-local` folder in `config-server-start.bat` file
and also check the version of `kernel-config-server.jar` towards the end
of the command.

Example:

`java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=native -Dspring.cloud.config.server.native.search-locations=file:C:++\++Users++\++myDell++\++mosipProject++\++mosip-config++\++sandbox-local -Dspring.cloud.config.server.accept-empty=true -Dspring.cloud.config.server.git.force-pull=false -Dspring.cloud.config.server.git.cloneOnStart=false -Dspring.cloud.config.server.git.refreshRate=0 kernel-config-server-1.2.0-20201016.134941-57.jar`.

As mentioned in the steps above, you may have to make some changes in
the two properties files as per your environment.

* Run the server by opening the `config-server-start.bat` file.

image:../../../../.gitbook/assets/run-server.png[../../../../.gitbook/assets/run-server]

The server should now be up and running.

Below are the configurations to be done in Eclipse:

{empty}1. Open Eclipse and run the project for one time as
`Java application`, so that it will create a Java application which you
can see in debug configurations and then change its name. (e.g.: project
name with environment - "`partner-management-dev`").

image:../../../../.gitbook/assets/partner-management-dev.PNG[../../../../.gitbook/assets/partner-management-dev]

{empty}2. Open the arguments and pass this
`-Ddomain.url=dev.mosip.net -Dapplication.base.url=http://localhost:8090 -Dspring.profiles.active=default -Dspring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:51000/config -Dspring.cloud.config.label=master`
in VM arguments.

{empty}3. Here, the domain URL represents the environment on which you
are working (eg., it can be `dev2.mosip.net` or `qa3.mosip.net`).

image:../../../../.gitbook/assets/vm-arguments.png[../../../../.gitbook/assets/vm-arguments]

{empty}4. Click Apply and then debug it (starts running). In the
console, you can see a message like
`"Started PartnerManagementService in 34.078 seconds (JVM running for 38.361)"`.

Policy management service also can run by following the above steps.

=== Partner management services API

* For API documentation, refer https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/api[here].
* The APIs can be tested with the help of *Swagger-UI* and *Postman*.
* Swagger is an interface description language for describing restful
APIs expressed using JSON. Can access Swagger-UI of
partner-management-services for dev-environment from
`https://dev.mosip.net/v1/partnermanager/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v1/partnermanager/v3/api-docs/swagger-config`
and localhost from
`http://localhost:9109/v1/partnermanager/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v1/partnermanager/v3/api-docs/swagger-config`.
* Can access Swagger-UI of policy-management-services for
dev-environment from
`https://dev.mosip.net/v1/policymanager/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v1/policymanager/v3/api-docs/swagger-config`
and localhost from
`http://localhost:9107/v1/policymanager/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v1/policymanager/v3/api-docs/swagger-config`.
* Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman
simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration
so you can create better APIs—faster. It is widely used tool for API
testing.
* Download the https://github.com/mosip/mosip-onboarding[JSON
collection] and then import it in your `postman`.
