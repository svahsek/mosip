== Overview

Partners are external entities or organisations who offer products or
services to ensure the effective implementation and operation of
MOSIP-based identity systems. PMS Portal is a web based application that
is designed to facilitate the collaboration and integration of external
partners in the MOSIP ecosystem. This portal serves as a central
platform to onboard all types of MOSIP partners, manage their details
and build partner specific functionalities for seamless interaction.

==== Who are the partners in MOSIP?

Partner Type

What do they do in MOSIP?

Why do they need PMS portal?

Device Provider

Provide devices for Registration and Authentication

Shares partner certificate which would be used to build a trust store in
MOSIP to cryptographically validate that the biometric data was captured
by a device issued by the device provider.

Provide make & model details of devices for book keeping.

Provide SBI information for book keeping.

FTM Chip Provider

Provide secure chip for Authentication devices

Shares partner certificate which would be used to build a trust store in
MOSIP to cryptographically validate that the biometric data was captured
by a device integrated with a chip issued by the FTM chip provider.

Provide chip model details for book keeping.

ABIS Partner

Provide ABIS engine to deduplicate biometrics

Shares partner certificate which would be used for encryption the
biometric data that is shared during deduplication.

The request for a policy based on which data is shared with them for
deduplication

Manual Adjudication System

Manual Adjudication system helps a biometric expert to compare two sets
of biometric data and few demographic data, so that, the adjudicator can
take the final decision that the identified record is actually a
duplicate.

Shares partner certificate which would be used for encryption the
biometric and demographic data that is shared during deduplication.

The request for a policy based on which data is shared with them for
adjudication

SDK Partner

Provides SDKs that are used for performing matching of two records,
checking the quality of the biometrics or generating biometric
templates.

They donâ€™t need Partner Management Portal

Authentication Partner

They are also called Relying Party or Service Providers who use MOSIP
authentication services for delivering services

Shares partner certificate which would be used to build a trust store in
MOSIP to cryptographically validate that they were the ones who were
authenticating the citizens also this certificate is used to encrypt the
response shared in e-KYC.

They choose a policy which they want to use and request for approval for
the policy from the partner admin.

Once a policy is approved, they can perform eSignet (OIDC Client) and/or
API based authentication.

They can create OIDC client for an approved policy which is used in
eSignet authentication.

They can generate API Keys against the policy in order to use it during
citizen authentication.

They can also deactivate an OIDC Client or API Key if it is compromised

MISP (MOSIP Infrastructure Service Providers)

They provide infrastructure services to MOSIP and help relying parties
(authentication partners) access the authentication endpoints exposed by
MOSIP

Share partner certificate which helps verify that the ISP is a genuine
partner, the certificate uploaded is generally not used in MOSIP.

Generate License Keys which would be used for during citizen
authentication.

ID Authentication Module / Online Verification Partner

Module that stores ID data used for authenticating the citizens

This is an internal module

Generally added from the backend by the administrator

Printing/ Credential Partner

They provide print solution

Shares partner certificate which would be used for encryption the face
and demographic data that is shared for printing the ID card.

The request for a policy based on which data is shared with them for
printing

==== What are the policies used in MOSIP?

* Data Share Policy
* Authentication Policy
* MISP Policy

Partner policies control the data that needs to be shared with a
partner. The policies reside in auth++_++policy table of mosip++_++pms
DB.
