===== 3 Language Preference

* The *notification language on PMS portal is based on the language
selected at login*, which *overrides* the default language selected at
registration.

selected by the user at the time of registration.

===== 4 Notification Retention:

* Notifications from the past 60 days are retained and available on the
PMS portal. Any notification older than 60 days is automatically deleted
from the system.

previously uploaded or corresponding MOSIP signed certificates which are
due to expire within the next 30 days; both on the PMS Portal and via
email.

These notifications are accessible to all partner types via the
