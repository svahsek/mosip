## Pre-requisites

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Access the Partner Management System:**

Visit the following URL to access the Partner Management System in the Collab environment: [Partner Management System](https://iam.collab.mosip.net/auth/realms/mosip/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=mosip-pms-client\&redirect_uri=https://api.collab.mosip.net/v1/partnermanager/login-redirect/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbXAuY29sbGFiLm1vc2lwLm5ldC8=\&state=b3feca86-1305-4bec-a861-c074af4bea6a\&response_type=code\&scope=email).

**Step 2: Login:**

* Get your credentials by simply registering yourself by clicking on `New user` on [PMS](https://iam.collab.mosip.net/auth/realms/mosip/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=mosip-pms-client\&redirect_uri=https://api.collab.mosip.net/v1/partnermanager/login-redirect/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbXAuY29sbGFiLm1vc2lwLm5ldC8=\&state=b3feca86-1305-4bec-a861-c074af4bea6a\&response_type=code\&scope=email).

**Step 3: Explore the features on the Partner Management System**
