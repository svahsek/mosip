== Reporting

=== Overview

MOSIP provides a reporting framework for real-time streaming of data and
visualization. The dashboards give a visual display of metrics and
important data to track the status of various pre and post-enrollment
processes. This data helps ID issuers with improving efficiency,
forecasting, and better decision-making. The framework has been used to
create a set of default dashboards using Kibana.

Details of reporting framework can be found
https://github.com/mosip/reporting/blob/release-1.2.0/README.md[here].
