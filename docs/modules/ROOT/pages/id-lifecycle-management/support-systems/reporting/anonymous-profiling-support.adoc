== Anonymous Profiling Support

=== Overview

When a country is implementing and running the ID program, people at the
forefront, like policymakers and other executives, will need to monitor
the progress. Progress can be measured with the help of various
attributes, like:

* total enrollment count
* gender profile for enrollment
* age group profile
* enrollment numbers and profiles per registration centre
* quality of biometric data captured

Information like this will allow policymakers to take corrective
measures as and when required.

Some examples are given below:

Example 1: If registration centres are setup for enrolling residents and
if they see that the number of women enrolling in a particular area is
less because of cultural factors, they can introduce a door-to-door
enrollment process to increase coverage.

Example 2: The quality of biometrics captured for a particular
registration centre or region can be monitored. And if it is found to be
unacceptable, they can proceed to replace the biometric devices in that
centre.

Example 3: They can compare the total number of enrollments against the
total number of UINs issued. If there is a big gap, they can then
address this by increasing the capacity of the registration processor
module to handle and process more packets.

=== Design

* In order to achieve this, we have published a fixed anonymized profile
of the users and ensured the same is accessible to a search engine such
as elastic search so that it can be used for analytics. The basic
guideline followed to create these profiles is that the limited dataset
should not violate the privacy of the person or point to specific
individuals. These JSON profiles are not configurable in the current
design and a code change is required to change them.
* This dataset is called an *anonymous profile* and is captured at
various stages in the ID lifecycle like pre-registration, registration
processing, ID issuance and authentication.
* As a part of this implementation, a new *anonymous++_++profile* table
is created in each of these modules and is populated as per the JSON
structure given below for each profile.

[width="100%",cols="30%,24%,46%",options="header",]
|===
|Module |Table name |Profile name
|Pre-registration |anonymous++_++profile |Anonymous Registration profile

|Registration Processor |anonymous++_++profile |Anonymous Registration
profile

|ID Repository |anonymous++_++profile |Anonymous Identity Issuance
profile

|Authentication |anonymous++_++profile |Anonymous Authentication profile
|===

_Note_: New DB tables are added for the anonymous profile because data
in existing tables are encrypted and cannot be used to create reports
and dashboards.

==== Anonymous Registration profile

* This profile will be used to capture data about enrollment. This
suggests that the user has started the registration process.
* This data is captured at two stages, i.e., during pre-registration and
registration processing.
* The same registration profile JSON is re-used to capture data in these
two modules.
* This profile data is captured in `anonymous++_++profile` tables under
the `mosip++_++prereg` `mosip++_++regprc` schemas.
* We can configure the stage at which the anonymous profile data in the
registration processor needs to be captured. This can be configured as a
part of the *registration processor camel routes* in the `mosip-config`
repository as shown below.

camel routes configuration]

*The profile will be available from version 1.2.0 and above.*

JSON structure of the registration profile is given below

==== Anonymous Identity issuance profile

* This profile data will be captured during the identity issuance
process when an entry is made in the ID repository.
* The profile data is captured in a `anonymous++_++profile` table under
the `mosip++_++idrepo` schema.

*The profile will be available from 1.1.5.5 and above.*

JSON structure of the identity issuance profile is given below:

....
{
  "processName": "", //New, Update or Lost. Correction is not included here
  "date": "", //Occurance of the event date. Just date with no time. 
  "oldProfile": {
    "yearOfBirth": "", //Only the year of birth is kept.  
    "gender": "", // Code for - Female, Male, Transgender, ...

=== Generating dashboards from Anonymous profile data

Reports and dashboards can be created using anonymous profile data. The
https://github.com/mosip/reporting/blob/release-1.2.0/README.md[reporting
framework] used for the platform can be used to push this data into
elastic search and dashboards can be configured using Kibana. A
dashboard created using *ID Issuance Anonymous profile* data is
available as a part of the reference implementation. The same is shown
below.

image:../../../.gitbook/assets/reports-id-issuance-2.png[../../../.gitbook/assets/reports-id-issuance-2]
