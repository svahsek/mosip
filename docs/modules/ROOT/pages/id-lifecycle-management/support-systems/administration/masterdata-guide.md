# Masterdata Guide

## Overview

Masterdata is the necessary base data to run MOSIP services. The data resides in [`mosip_master` database](https://github.com/mosip/admin-services/tree/release-1.2.0/db_scripts/mosip_master). This data needs to be customized for a country specific deployment.

## Populating masterdata

Masterdata may be uploaded in the following manner:

1. One-time bulk upload:
   1. [Default masterdata](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-data/tree/release-1.2.0/mosip_master/xlsx) (for sandbox installation): Using [Helm chart](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/tree/develop/deployment/v3/mosip/masterdata-loader). The default data uploaded during sandbox installation is available in [mosip-data](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-data/tree/release-1.2.0/mosip_master/xlsx).
   2. Country specific data: Using [Python scripts](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/tree/develop/deployment/v3/mosip/masterdata-loader).
2. Updates: Updates to tables may be done using the [Admin Portal](test/admin-portal-user-guide.md).

## Creating country specific data

The tables that need to be modified for country specific data are listed below. Other tables in `mosip_master` DB are either system-filled or pre-filled and not to be modified.

### Common guidelines

* Copy Excel files from [mosip-data](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-data/tree/release-1.2.0/mosip_master/xlsx) to a folder.
* For all tables listed below modify `lang_code` and add corresponding rows for your [configured languages](../../supporting-services/module-configuration.md#languages).
* Modify the files for your deployment as per guide below.
* Upload **first time** using scripts given [here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/tree/release-1.2.0/deployment/v3/mosip/kernel/masterdata).
* Subsequently, update data ONLY using [Admin Portal](test/admin-portal-user-guide.md).
