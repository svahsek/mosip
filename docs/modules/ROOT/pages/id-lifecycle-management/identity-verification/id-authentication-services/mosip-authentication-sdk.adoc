== MOSIP Authentication SDK

==== *Overview*

The *MOSIP Authentication SDK* is a (Python-based) wrapper designed to
simplify interaction with the *MOSIP Authentication Service*, enabling
seamless integration of robust identity verification workflows into
Python applications. This SDK abstracts complex details such as
request/response structures, encryption/decryption mechanisms, and error
handling, allowing developers to implement authentication workflows
quickly and efficiently. +
 +
Currently, the SDK supports OTP authentication and demographic
authentication. Future updates will expand its functionality to include
biometric authentication. +
 +
Additionally, although the SDK is currently Python-based, we will soon
be expanding support to other languages to offer broader compatibility.

==== Purpose

This page provides an overview of the Authentication SDK, outlining its
functionality and providing a
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/id-authentication-services/mosip-authentication-sdk#installation-process[detailed
process for installing] and testing the IDA API using the SDK.

===== *Why Use This SDK?*

While building your solution around MOSIP, it is recommended to use
eSignet, MOSIP’s OAuth- and OIDC-based solution, for most online and
scalable authentication needs due to its modern, standards-compliant
design. However, the MOSIP Authentication SDK offers its own advantages,
particularly in the flexibility it provides, making it an invaluable
tool for addressing a wide range of identity verification requirements.

[arabic]
. *Ease of Integration*: Simplifies the process of working with MOSIP’s
APIs, reducing the learning curve for developers
. *Consistency*: Provides a uniform interface for different
authentication operations, ensuring a consistent experience
. *Security*: Manages encryption and decryption of requests and
responses, adhering to MOSIP’s security standards
. *Flexibility*: Supports multiple authentication methods, including
demographic authentication, offering versatility in identity
verification workflows

==== *Key Features*

[arabic]
. *Simplified API Interaction*: Abstracts the complexity of direct API
calls to MOSIP services
. *Support for Multiple Authentication Workflows*: Includes controllers
for both KYC-based and general authentication
. *Comprehensive Configuration*: Allows customization via a
configuration file (authenticator-config.toml)
. *Secure Handling*: Automatically encrypts requests and decrypts
responses to ensure secure communication
. *Error Management*: Provides clear error messages and handling
mechanisms

==== *Controllers*

The SDK provides two primary controllers, each designed for a specific
authentication workflow:

[arabic]
. kyc-auth-controller +
Used for *Know Your Customer (KYC)* authentication. This controller
facilitates verification using demographic data or OTP verification. +
*Reference*:
https://mosip.github.io/documentation/1.2.0/authentication-service.html#tag/kyc-auth-controller[KYC
Auth Controller API Documentation]
. auth-controller +
Used for general authentication of individuals, allowing verification
based on a wide range of identifiers such as demographic authentication
and OTP authentication. +
*Reference*:

Controller API Documentation]

==== *Method Reference*

The SDK provides two key methods for authentication:

[arabic]
. kyc *Method*: Used for KYC-based authentication by verifying an
individual’s demographic data and OTP.
. auth *Method*: Handles general authentication requests with similar
parameters as kyc.

Both methods require the individual’s ID (individual++_++id), ID type
(individual++_++id++_++type), demographic data (DemographicsModel),
optionally an OTP, biometric data, and consent confirmation. These
methods streamline identity verification processes for diverse use
cases. +
 +
Please refer below to know more about the methods.

===== kyc Method

Authenticates an individual using KYC-based workflow.

[source,python]
----
kyc(
    individual_id: str,
    individual_id_type: str,
    demographic_data: DemographicsModel,
    otp_value: Optional[str] = None,
    biometrics: Optional[List[BiometricModel]] = None,
    consent: bool = False
) -> Response
----

===== auth Method

Performs a general authentication.

[source,python]
----
auth(
    individual_id: str,
    individual_id_type: str,
    demographic_data: DemographicsModel,
    otp_value: Optional[str] = None,
    biometrics: Optional[List[BiometricModel]] = None,
    consent: bool = False
) -> Response
----

*Common Parameters*

* individual++_++id _(str)_: The unique ID of the individual (e.g., VID,
UIN)
* individual++_++id++_++type _(str)_: Specifies the type of ID used
(e.g., VID, UIN)
* demographic++_++data _(DemographicsModel)_: A model containing
demographic details such as name and address
* otp++_++value _(Optional++[++str++]++)_: The One-Time Password (OTP)
for authentication, if applicable
* consent _(bool)_: Indicates if the individual has given consent for
authentication

==== Installation Process

*Pre-requisites:*

Before beginning the installation and configuration of this SDK, the
user must complete the following steps:

[arabic]
. *Register as an Authentication Partner (AP)*: Register their
organization as an Authentication Partner. Please refer to this link
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/partners#authentication-partner-ap[here] and
follow the steps for registration.
. *Obtain the IDA-FIR(K21) Certificate*: The user must possess the
IDA-FIR(K21) certificate. The certificate can be obtained
https://mosip.github.io/documentation/1.2.0/authentication-internal-service.html#operation/getCertificate[here].
. *Provide required details in the request*:
[arabic]
.. app id: IDA
.. ref : IDA-FIR
. *Install pip on the machine*: The user should install pip to manage
Python packages. Installation instructions can be found
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/[here].

the authentication service

For detailed guidance on performing these steps during the installation
process, please refer to the model implementation below.

*Basic Example:*

[source,python]
----
from mosip_auth_sdk import MOSIPAuthenticator
from mosip_auth_sdk.models import DemographicsModel, BiometricModel

# Initialize the authenticator
authenticator = MOSIPAuthenticator(config={
    # Configuration settings (refer to authenticator-config.toml for details)
})

# Create demographic data
demographics_data = DemographicsModel(
    name="John Doe",
    address="123 Main Street"
    # Add other fields as required
)

# Perform KYC authentication
response = authenticator.kyc(
    individual_id="123456789",
    individual_id_type="VID",
    demographic_data=demographics_data,
    otp_value="1234",
    consent=True
)

# Handle the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    decrypted_data = authenticator.decrypt_response(response.json())
    print("Authentication successful:", decrypted_data)
else:
    print("Authentication failed:", response.json())
----

===== *Error Handling*

The SDK provides clear error messages and codes to help diagnose issues
effectively. Review the errors field in the response for details.
