== ID Authentication Services

=== Overview

ID Authentication is built as an independent service that can be seeded
with data for authentication by any system, including MOSIP. In the
current design, we can have multiple IDA modules running from a single
issuer.

The ID Authentication (IDA) module of MOSIP consists of the following
services:

[arabic]
. Authentication Services
. OTP Service
. Internal Services

To learn more about it, refer to the below video:

=== Authentication Services

The services mentioned below are used by Authentication or e-KYC
Partners.

* Authentication Service: used to authenticate an individual’s UIN/VID
using one or more authentication types.
* KYC Authentication Service: used to request e-KYC for an individual’s
UIN/VID using one or more authentication types.

=== OTP Request Service

OTP Request Service is used by Authentication/e-KYC Partners to generate
OTP for an individual’s UIN/VID. The generated OTP is stored in IDA DB
for validation during OTP Authentication.

=== Internal Services

[arabic]
. Internal Authentication Service - The authentication service used by
internal MOSIP modules such as Resident Service, Registration Processor
and Registration Client to authenticate individuals.
. Internal OTP Service - used by Resident Service to generate OTP for an
Individual for performing OTP Authentication.
. Authentication Transaction History Service - used by Resident Service
to retrieve a paginated list of authentication and OTP Request
transactions for an individual.

==== Credential issuance callback

* link:../id-authentication.md[ID Authentication] uses the credential
data of the individuals for performing authentication.
* This credential is requested by
link:../../identity-issuance/id-repository/[ID Repository] upon any UIN
insertion/update or VID creation.
* The credential is created by Credential Service uploaded to
link:../../supporting-components/datashare.md[Datashare] service and the
Datashare URL is sent to ID-Authentication using
link:../../supporting-services/websub/[WebSub] message.
* WebSub invokes the credential-issuance callback in
link:../id-authentication.md[ID Authentication] where the credential
data is downloaded from Datashare and then stored in IDA DB.

=== Key generation

ID Authentication needs the below
link:../../supporting-services/keymanager/keys.md[keys] to be generated
during the deployment for usage in Authentication Service.

[arabic]
. `IDA IDENTITY++_++CACHE`(K18) symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt the
Zero-knowledge 10K random keys
. `IDA ROOT` master key(K15)), `IDA module` master key(K16), `IDA-SIGN`
master key
. Base keys `CRED++_++SERVICE`(K22), `IDA-FIR`(K21), `INTERNAL`(K19),
`PARTNER`(K20)

=== Authentication client demo app

This is a reference application to demonstrate how authentication and
KYC can be performed by
link:../../support-systems/partner-management-services/partners.md#partner-types[Authentication
Partners].

Refer to the
https://github.com/mosip/authentication-demo-ui/tree/release-1.2.0[repository]
for more details.

Below is the sample authentication demo UI image.

=== Authentication Error Eventing

The ID Authentication service now offers an *Authentication Error
Eventing* feature. When an authentication related error occurs, a
message will prompt to the user to retry after a few minutes. In the
meantime, Kafka event will be triggered to publish the data to the
designated topic, allowing subscribers to receive a message for further
processing.

This feature can be utilized for different use cases such as on demand
template extraction, report generations, to identify any fraudulent
occurrence etc.

One such use case is on demand template extraction. In an instance where
a user has successfully registered and obtained a valid UIN/VID but
encounters an error during authentication due to unavailability of the
entered UIN/VID in the IDA DB, this feature comes into play. This issue
tends to occur particularly during periods of high registration and UIN
generation volumes, where additional time is needed for data
transmission from the ID Repo to the IDA DB. This authentication error
eventing feature will help in capturing the errors related to this issue
and event will be created. subscribers can capture this event and
process them accordingly to enable the template extraction to proceed
with the authentication/verification process.

This feature is designed to be a plugin feature in IDA, which can be
configured based on the requirement. To enable the feature below
property should be marked as `True`:

`mosip.ida.authentication.error.eventing.enabled=true`

Once this property is enabled, related kafka property setup should be
installed to utilize the feature.

For further guidance on this feature, you can refer
https://github.com/mosip/id-authentication/blob/release-1.2.1.x/docs/authentication_error_eventing.md[here]

Subscribers who will be subscribing to the event should be onboarded as
authentication partners. To on board subscribers below steps needed to
be followed:

*Steps to onboard the subscribers*:

[arabic]
. Create a policygroup by the name `mpolicygroup-default-tempextraction`
. The policy should be configured to not allow any authentication to be
carryout but the partner except reading the kafka event. To attain this,
`allowedAuthTypes` should be marked as `null`

For example:

`++{++"authTokenType":"partner","allowedKycAttributes":++[{++"attributeName":"fullName"},++{++"attributeName":"gender"}, ++{++"attributeName":"residenceStatus"},++{++"attributeName":"dateOfBirth"},++{++"attributeName":"photo"}++]++,"kycLanguages":++[++"ara","eng"++]++,"allowedAuthTypes":++[]++}`

[arabic, start=3]
. Publish the policygroup and policy
. Refer this
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/partners#authentication-partner-ap[link] to
onboard the subscribers as authentication partners. The name of the
partner should be `mpartner-default-tempextraction`

*Note*: This feature is exclusively available in ID Authentication
version 1.2.1.0 only. To configure the latest version of IDA and access
this new feature, please refer to this link
