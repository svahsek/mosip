For the system Java wrappers to find this JDK, symlink it with
  sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-11.jdk

openjdk@11 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have openjdk@11 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openjdk@11 you may need to set:
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11/include"
==> Summary
üç∫  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk@11/11.0.24: 669 files, 296.4MB
==> Running `brew cleanup openjdk@11`...
Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.
Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).

# Move Inji Docs to Inji.io
Hi POs, This is to inform that we are planning to move inji documentation from docs.mosip.io/inji to our newly acquired domain and thus the subdomain docs.inji.io. While we are analyzing which all back-links will break across our documentation (docs.mosip.io, docs.mosip.io/esignet etc ) we need your help in identifying if the website, marketing decks or presentations too refers to the inji docs site. If it does, please let us know.
